Some things which are to be done
--------------------------------

- cgroups should be used instead of explicit task stops by signals
- dump/restore of network connections
- dump/restore of IPC
- consider dropping VMA data from Elf contents but to use program header instead
- (by Pekka Enberg) add a 'make check' or tools/test script that people can run to
  do a full fork/dump/restore/kill cycle
- (by Pekka Enberg) convert kernel patches into a proper kernel git tree people can pull
- cr-restore.c should be significantly refactored
- 'crtools show' should support showing only a subset of resources dumped such as
  pipes/vma/ and etc...
- add bash completion file
- switch to getopt()
- comments for seize_task
- anything related to seizing should be in seize.c file instead of util.c
