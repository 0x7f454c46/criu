Some things which are to be done
--------------------------------

- to restore anonymous shared pages safetly we need a global
  mutex so there will be no activity on another thread until
  mmap+page_read pair finish its job
- cgroups should be used instead of explicit task stops by signals
- dump/restore of network connections
- dump/restore of IPC
- consider dropping VMA data from Elf contents but to use program header instead
- (by Pekka Enberg) add a 'make check' or tools/test script that people can run to
  do a full fork/dump/restore/kill cycle
- (by Pekka Enberg) convert kernel patches into a proper kernel git tree people can pull
- cr-restore.c should be significantly refactored
- 'crtools show' should support showing only a subset of resources dumped such as
  pipes/vma/ and etc...
- add bash completion file

Some notes on code
------------------

- need to handle out cr_fdset(s), they are getting used more frequently
  than I initially thought, including the usage only of a few file descriptors
  while the whole set is always allocated
